# History
```sh
    Since time immemorial, humanity has succumbed to a group of more powerful people, being outraged, stripped, mutilated and colonized. The Shamans, a race of people who are dedicated to colonizing villages leaving all their inhabitants under a regime of one leader and no one to inhabit them.
        According to legend, the shamans are guided by a leader, whose identity is still a mystery, it is said that only the highest positions within the group know who this person is. Their mission is to assassinate people from any village to use them as experiments, and to plunder the energies of the spirits that live around the forest of the villages.
        The guardians of the forest, are those who have cared for hundreds of years for these wooded areas, however, once the energy is extracted, they gradually become corrupted until they have no clear objective of protection, and instead are dedicated to annihilate everything that is against the plan of the shamans.
        The experimentation in the villages has led the shamans to colonize many more locations and all to enlarge their army of soldiers, which are composed of dismembered parts of the multiple inhabitants in the villages. The objective is still clear for these 'soldiers', created in fortresses to pass the tests designed by the leaders of the group, so that in this way they become part of the troop, the strongest will pass and follow the orders of the shamans, even so, the losers will be part of the tests where they will perish at the hands of the new malformed recruits.
        Even so, the legend is still incomplete, under the orders of the shamans no body created by them can think for themselves. Questions such as Who is the leader? Why is he so interested in collecting the energy of the spirits? Why are even more soldiers needed? They remain unanswered. This will be the mission, to find the ultimate purpose.

# Main characters
```sh
'73 - 1'
Exemplary soldier, created from different human parts, for destruction and loyalty to the shamans. Distrustful, authoritarian and determined to be the best soldier ever, destroying anyone who gets in the way.

'Mim'
A guardian class spirit of the forest, the only one who has managed to escape shaman attacks. He used to live off the magical energy of the forest, nowadays corrupted and weak, as he has no elixir to continue, but determined to change history with an ally.

'SWORD'
It has an attack ability, becoming a sword capable of destroying enemies if the wielder has the ability to exploit this potential.

'Enemies'
Spirits of the forest corrupted from attacks by shamans. Incapable of thinking, reasoning or remembering things, but with the purpose of harming anyone who is against the shamans plan, nowadays they inhabit areas near towns or training caves where the newly created soldiers test their skills.
